= Replay UI
include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

When developing GitHub Apps, more often than not, being able to replay an event is useful.
It can be cumbersome to trigger the events from the GitHub UI by creating issues, pull requests, commenting...

GitHub offers a replay UI for this purpose in the `Advanced` tab of your application page.
It is not very practical when developing though as you are not able to search and,
sometimes, the details of the events are not available immediately.

Quarkus GitHub App offers an integrated Replay UI when developing in dev mode.
You can inspect the received payloads and replay events from there.
It is available at http://localhost:8080/replay/.
