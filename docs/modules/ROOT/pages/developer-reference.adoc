== Events

=== Listening to events

To listen to an event, you need to create a method with one of the event annotations:

[source,java]
----
class CreateComment {

	void onOpen(@Issue.Opened GHEventPayload.Issue issuePayload) throws IOException {
		issuePayload.getIssue().comment("Hello from my GitHub App");
	}
}
----

A few observations:

* The method may either be package-protected or public.
* Most of the GitHub API methods throw ``IOException``s so your methods need to propagate it. We have some nice error handling.
* The payload type needs to be consistent with the event type.

A method may listen to several events as long as they share the same payload type:

[source,java]
----
class IssueListener {

	void onOpenOrEdit(@Issue.Opened @Issue.Edited GHEventPayload.Issue issuePayload) {
		// do something
	}
}
----

Several methods can listen to the same event types but you cannot control the order of their execution.
We use CDI events under the hood and the execution of event observer methods cannot be ordered.
If you need ordering for several steps, use a single method to control the execution of these steps.
They can be split in smaller private methods if need be.

=== Event types

Here are all the events currently supported, together with the type of the payload that will be injected.

|===

If you want to access the low level JSON payload, you can use the raw `GitHubEvent`, either by substituting it to the API payload:

[source,java]
----
class TriageIssue {

    void triageIssue(@Issue.Opened GitHubEvent gitHubEvent) {
        // do something
    }
}
----

Or by adding it as an additional parameter:

[source,java]
----
class TriageIssue {

    void triageIssue(@Issue.Opened GHEventPayload.Issue issuePayload, GitHubEvent gitHubEvent) {
        // do something
    }
}
----

The `GitHubEvent` exposes the raw JSON either as a string (via `GitHubEvent#getPayload()`) or as a Vert.x `JsonObject` (via `GitHubEvent#getParsedPayload()`),
together with some additional information like the installation id, the event or the action.

If you miss an event type, it is also possible to listen to events by using the `@RawEvent` annotation.
The `@RawEvent` annotation allows you to listen to all events/actions, and you may also specify the event and the action you want to listen to.

When using the `@RawEvent` annotation, the only allowed payload parameter type is `GitHubEvent`.

[source,java]
----
class ActOnDeploymentProtectionRule {

    void onDeploymentProtectionRule(@RawEvent(event = "deployment_protection_rule", action = "requested") GitHubEvent gitHubEvent) {
        // do something
    }
}
----

Both `event` and `action` are optional and you can listen to all events by using the following code:

[source,java]
----
class CatchAll {

    void catchAll(@RawEvent GitHubEvent gitHubEvent) {
        // do something
    }
}
----

[TIP]
====
If you miss an event type, please report it by https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-github-app/issues/new[creating an issue].
We try to add to contribute to the https://github.com/hub4j/github-api[Hub4j GitHub API] all the event types that are useful.

When missing an event type, there are two options:

* Either it is not available in the https://github.com/hub4j/github-api[Hub4j GitHub API] and in this case, it needs to be implemented there first in `GHEventPayload`.
* Or it is available in the https://github.com/hub4j/github-api[Hub4j GitHub API] and it is just a matter of adding a new annotation in https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-github-app/tree/main/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkiverse/githubapp/event[Quarkus GitHub App] and the appropriate documentation in the https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-github-app/blob/main/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/developer-reference.adoc#event-types[Developer reference page]. The annotation will be automatically taken into account.
====

== Configuration file

For some usage, you might need to include a configuration file that is repository-specific and versioned.

The Quarkus GitHub App extension supports the following features:

* Automatic injection of config files into your methods.
* YAML, JSON or text config files.
* Automatic deserialization of your YAML or JSON config files into Java POJOs using Jackson.

Injecting a configuration file in your method is as simple as:

[source, java]
----
class TriageIssue {

    void triageIssue(@Issue.Opened GHEventPayload.Issue issuePayload,
            @ConfigFile("quarkus-bot-java.yml") QuarkusBotConfigFile quarkusBotConfigFile) {
        // do something
    }
}
----

The configuration file `.github/quarkus-bot-java.yml` present in the default branch of the repository
for which the event has been triggered
is parsed and deserialized to a `QuarkusBotConfigFile` instance using Jackson.

If the file does not exist in the repository, `quarkusBotConfigFile` will be null.

If you want to get the content of the configuration file as is, use a `String`.

Note that `@ConfigFile` injection supports using `Optional<YourConfigType>`.

[TIP]
====
If your repository is private, reading configuration files requires your GitHub App to have the `Contents` `Read` permission.
====

[NOTE]
====
By default, the config file path is relative to the `.github/` directory.

You can reference a file outside this directory by using an `/absolute/path`.
====

== Error handler

The Quarkus GitHub App extension provides an error handler that will log errors with as many details as possible.

You can customize the error handler by creating a CDI bean implementing `io.quarkiverse.githubapp.error.ErrorHandler`:

[WARNING]
====
Some errors may be triggered before the payload has been parsed.
In this case, the `payload` parameter passed to the `handleError()` method is `null`.
====

== Injecting a GitHub instance

When you need to access the authenticated `GitHub` instance, for instance to call `GitHub#getMyself()`,
simply inject it into your method:

[source, java]
----
class TriageIssue {

    void triageIssue(@Issue.Opened GHEventPayload.Issue issuePayload, GitHub gitHub) {
        gitHub.getMyself();
    }
}
----

The injected `GitHub` instance is authenticated as an installation.

== Injecting a GraphQL client

For some purposes, using the GitHub GraphQL API might get handy (typically to access the Discussions API that is only available in the GraphQL API).
In the same way you can inject an authenticated `GitHub` instance, you can inject an authenticated `DynamicGraphQLClient` as follows:

[source, java]
----
class TriageIssue {

    void triageIssue(@Issue.Opened GHEventPayload.Issue issuePayload, DynamicGraphQLClient gitHubGraphQLClient) {
        // do something GraphQLy with gitHubGraphQLClient
    }
}
----

The injected `DynamicGraphQLClient` instance is authenticated as an installation.

`DynamicGraphQLClient` is a dynamic SmallRye GraphQL client.
You can find more information about the SmallRye GraphQL client https://quarkus.io/guides/smallrye-graphql-client[here] and https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql[here].

== Webhook events

While Quarkus GitHub App was primarily designed as a tool to develop GitHub Apps,
it is also possible to use it to handle your webhook requests.

It will take care of all the ceremony of authenticating the requests and will save you a lot of boilerplate.

There are a few differences though:

- You will have to use `@RawEvent` to listen to the events and get the raw JSON of the payload.
- Webhook requests don't provide an installation id so we can't initialize an installation GitHub client nor a GraphQL client.

The default `GitHub` REST client instance that can be injected is an application client and has so few permissions that it is not really useful.

While it could be a major inconvenience, we present a nice feature dedicated to this use case in the following section.

== Providing a personal access token

When using Quarkus GitHub App, in most cases, the REST and GraphQL clients provided by the installation are what you are looking for:
they have the permissions allowed for this GitHub App and it should be enough to do what your GitHub App has been designed for.

However, there are corner cases where you might need a client with additional permissions,
the most common one is when you deal with webhooks as presented in the previous section.

For this situation, you can define a personal access token by using the `quarkus.github-app.personal-access-token` configuration property.
The personal access token provided in this property will be used to initialize:

- an authenticated `GitHub` REST client
- an authenticated `DynamicGraphQL` GraphQL client

These clients will be automatically injected in your methods when injecting clients *if the payload doesn't provide an installation id*
(if it does provide one, the regular installation clients will be injected).

It is also possible to directly obtain the clients authenticated with the personal access token by injecting the `TokenGitHubClients` CDI bean.
It provides methods to get the authenticated REST and GraphQL clients.

== Credentials provider

Quarkus GitHub App supports the usage of a https://quarkus.io/guides/credentials-provider[`CredentialsProvider`] to provide some of the configuration properties
that you might not want to appear in a configuration file.

You can find all the information you need about ``CredentialsProvider``s in the https://quarkus.io/guides/credentials-provider[dedicated guide].

The basic principle is that you provide a CDI bean that will implement the `CredentialsProvider` and will provide the values for the supported configuration properties.
It can either be provided by the https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-vault[Vault extension] if you are using HashiCorp Vault or you can provide you own custom `CredentialsProvider` implementation.

Using a `CredentialsProvider` is easy:

- Make sure you have an implementation of `CredentialsProvider` and that it is a `@Singleton` or `@ApplicationScoped` CDI bean.
- Set the `quarkus.github-app.credentials-provider` to define the name of the credentials provider.
See it as the name of a keyring containing your Quarkus GitHub App secrets.
- For the given name, your `CredentialsProvider` may return a `Map` containing entries for `githubAppPrivateKey` and/or `githubAppWebhookSecret`.
You can use the constants present in `io.quarkiverse.githubapp.Credentials` for practicality.

That is all you need to do:
Quarkus GitHub App will then automatically use the values provided by the `CredentialsProvider` for the private key and the webhook secret.

== Customizing the GitHub clients

You can customize the GitHub clients initialized by Quarkus GitHub App
by creating a CDI bean implementing `io.quarkiverse.githubapp.GitHubCustomizer`.

For instance:

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class MyGitHubCustomizer implements GitHubCustomizer {

    @Override
    public void customize(GitHubBuilder builder) {
       // call methods of the builder
    }
}
----

This will apply the customizations to both the application clients and the installation clients.

However, some customizations can't be applied to the application clients such as configuring a rate limit checker.
You may customize the application clients differently by implementing `customizeApplicationClient(GitHubBuilder)`:

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class MyGitHubCustomizer implements GitHubCustomizer {

    @Override
    public void customize(GitHubBuilder builder) { <1>
       // call methods of the builder
    }

    @Override
    public void customizeApplicationClient(GitHubBuilder builder) { <2>
       // call methods of the builder
    }
}
----
<1> Customize the installation clients.
<2> Customize the application clients.

[NOTE]
.About application and installation clients
====
A GitHub App relies on two types of GitHub clients:

- The application client: it is authenticated as the application, it has very few permissions and is mostly used to create installation-specific tokens.
- The installation client: it is created specifically for an installation of the application (i.e. it is tied where the application is installed) and it is the client you consume in your GitHub App code. It has the permissions you defined for your GitHub App.
