= Create a GitHub App
include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

== Initialize your Quarkus application

A Quarkus GitHub App is a standard Quarkus application.

You can create one including the Quarkus GitHub App extension using the following https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling[Quarkus CLI] command:

WARNING: Make sure you use the `ðŸ“‹` button to copy the command.

[source, bash, subs=attributes+]
----
quarkus create app \
    -x quarkus-github-app \ <1>
    org.acme:my-github-app <2>
----
<1> The Quarkus GitHub App extension.
<2> The GA of your Maven project.

[TIP]
====
On Windows and macOS, it is recommended to concatenate all the options on one line (without `\`),
as the `\` might not be correctly interpreted.
====

[NOTE]
======
We highly recommend the usage of the https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling[Quarkus CLI] but if you cannot install it or prefer using Maven,
you can create a Quarkus GitHub Action project using the following Maven command:

WARNING: Make sure you use the `ðŸ“‹` button to copy the command.

[source, bash, subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DplatformVersion={quarkus-version} \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \ <1>
    -DprojectArtifactId=my-github-app \ <2>
    -Dextensions="io.quarkiverse.githubapp:quarkus-github-app:{quarkus-github-app-version}" <3>
----
<1> The groupId of your Maven project.
<2> The artifactId of your Maven project.
<3> The Quarkus GitHub App extension.

[TIP]
====
On Windows and macOS, it is recommended to concatenate all the options on one line (without `\`),
as the `\` might not be correctly interpreted.
====
======

This command creates a regular Quarkus Maven project.
You can add additional Quarkus extensions or Java dependencies.

Once the project is created, go to the `my-github-app` directory.

== Initialize the configuration

As the configuration is environment-specific and you probably don't want to commit it in your repository,
the best is to create a `.env` file.

The content of your `.env` file should be as follows:

[source,properties]
------
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_APP_ID=<the numeric app id>
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_APP_NAME=<the name of your app>
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL=<your Smee.io channel URL>
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your webhook secret>
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\
                  <your private key>                          \
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
------

QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_APP_ID:: The numeric app id appearing in the `App ID` field.
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_APP_NAME:: The name of your app is the one appearing in the GitHub URL.
It is only used to improve usability in dev mode.
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL:: The URL you obtained when you created your Smee.io channel. If you are using services like https://ngrok.com/[ngrok], you don't need to set it.
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET:: The webhook secret you created at the previous step.
QUARKUS_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY:: The content of the private key you generated and downloaded.
Open the key file with a text editor as key viewers usually only show fingerprints.

[TIP]
====
Don't forget to add backslashes at the end of the lines of your private key (except the last one).
In a property file, that is how a multi-line value is considered one value.
====

Once you have created your `.env`, you are all set.

== Start dev mode and enjoy

If you are familiar with Quarkus, you already know the dev mode which improves productivity a lot.
If you are not, the principle is that you start your application once and code:
Quarkus will take care of reloading the application when it receives a request.

Just execute the following command to start Quarkus in dev mode:

[source]
----
quarkus dev
----

[TIP]
====
If you have a configuration error, it's probably because you did something wrong with the `.env` file.
Check the instructions above carefully.
====

== Time to code

That's it! You are done with the setup and you can code your GitHub App.
Sky is the limit.

Your newly created GitHub App comes with a small example:

[source, java]
----
package org.acme;

import java.io.IOException;

import org.kohsuke.github.GHEventPayload;

import io.quarkiverse.githubapp.event.Issue;

class MyGitHubApp {

    void onOpen(@Issue.Opened GHEventPayload.Issue issuePayload) throws IOException {
        issuePayload.getIssue().comment(":wave: Hello from my GitHub App");
    }
}
----

Every time you create an issue in your GitHub project, a comment will be posted by your GitHub App.

In details:

* No need for the `public` modifier, your classes and methods can be package protected.
* We listen to the `@Issue.Opened` event i.e. this method will be called for each issue opened.
* A payload of type `GHEventPayload.Issue` will be injected in our method automatically.
  This class is provided by the https://github.com/hub4j/github-api[Hub4j GitHub API].

== That's all folks!

You are done developing your first Quarkus GitHub App.

Obviously, the code from `MyGitHubApp` is not very useful in real life, but it is a good start and by using this framework:

* You can listen to all the events currently supported by the https://github.com/hub4j/github-api[Hub4j GitHub API].
* You have the full power of Quarkus with live coding, easy configuration, dependency injection, native executables and more.
* You can write xref:testing.adoc[automated tests that simulate GitHub events] and assert the behavior of your application.
* You have at your disposal the full ecosystem of Quarkus extensions and the broader Java ecosystem.

Our xref:replay-ui.adoc[Replay UI] will come handy while developing your GitHub App.

You can learn more about all the events you can listen to in our xref:developer-reference.adoc[Developer Reference].

When you are done developing your application, please refer to xref:push-to-production.adoc[Push to Production].
